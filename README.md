# Calorie Counter App

The Calorie Counter App allows a user to recieve a personalised caloric maintenance figure, the calculation takes place one the user has registered an account on the app and entered the specified data.

## Getting Started
----

Firstly, the project has way too many files in order to upload onto GitHub therefore a document has been provided with a download link.

Unzip the downloaded file; note there are two seperate folders:

* A folder containing the server (Eclipse/IntelliJ)
* Another containing the app (Android Studio)

If you do not already have both a Java based IDE and Android Studio installed, refer to prerequisites. 

### Prerequisites
----

A Java Based IDE is required in order to run the server required to provide the app with the necessary functionality to perform as expected. I personally recommend the two below, however feel free to use your own preference.

Choose one of the guides below:
* [A comprehensive guide on how to install Eclipse](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/howto/EclipseJava_HowTo.html)
* [A comprehensive guide on how to install IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/installation-guide.html?section=Windows)

Android Studio is the IDE required to run the app on your PC, below is a guide on how to install it.

### Installing
----

Once you have both IDE's up and running;

```
Open each of the project's in their designated program.
```
```
Run the server
```
```
Run the app
```
***

There is a test account up and running on android studio for simplified use of the app, the credentials are:

**Username: testq**

**Password: test**

Alternatively, you can input your own details and make an account.
If you do this, once you login, be sure to go to your profile and edit your details in order to receive any personalised information.
